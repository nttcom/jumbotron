Allowing you to participate on the big screen

## How it works

Access the website at **https://jt.skyway.io/**

The default site is in Japanese. If you need the site to be in **English**, you can switch the language at the top right hand side. There is a button to toggle the site between English and Japanese.

The site has two components: For the **Organizer** and **Participant**.

## Organizer

The Organizer can select a channel number by clicking the **Change** button or you can manually input the channel number into the textbox. After selecting the channel number, the organizer will then click on "**Start the Viewer**". You will be redirected to the viewer page. From this page, you will be able to see your participants as they join your channel. The number of connections will be updated when there are participants connected to your viewer.

## Participants

After the organizer has selected the channel number, the participants can input the same channel number and click on "**Start the Camera**". Participants will be redirected to a page where you will appear on the Organizer's Viewer. Participants can also use mobile devices with camera to participate in the viewer.

##During the session
Participants will appear on the viewer on the Organizer's Screen. In the event when we need to hear the participants, the organizer can click on the selected participant and the participant's screen will enlarge on the view. During this time, voice transmission is activated, the participant can express his/her opinions or ask questions. By clicking on the enlarged screen, the viewer will return to the previous state and will display all participants again.

##End of session
When ending the session, participants can just close the window and you will be disconnected from the particular channel. If the organizer closes the window, allactive participants will be disconnected from the channel.

##Extra features
You can copy the Camera URL by clicking on the textbox. The channel number is a four digit number indicated after the "#" sign. You can also share the Camera URL via Email by clicking the "**Camera URL through Email**" button. By clicking this button, you will be redirected to a page with your default mail client with pre-written email content. Simply input the recipients' email address and you are ready to go. Recipients can join Organizer's viewer by accessing the link in their email.
